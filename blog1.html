                        <br><br>

                        I was so much in love with my senior school sweetheart and did so many crazy things which I still wonder sometimes how I did that .. üòÆ
                        <br><br>
                        After passing out class 12th boards exam she left to her hometown in Etawah(u.p.) and I was in Agra . So we were in kinda of distance relationship .
                        <br><br>
                        One fine day I decided to meet her somehow.
                        <br><br>
                        I told my mother that I have a cricket match today I am going for it.
                        <br><br>
                        (My mother had a little bit idea of my relationship and she was not happy with that because she was too concerned about my future)
                        <br><br>
                        I left home at 5 in the morning and took the train from Agra to her city and informed her.
                        <br><br>
                        Somehow I managed to reach her home around 12 and met her mother I told her mother that I came to see my bua(father's sister) so thought to meet you also.
                        <br><br>
                        During that time my mom was calling me again and again . At that I scared out because I was around 120km away from my home and nobody knows about it and my mom kept calling me to come home ASAP.
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to tell my mom that it still takes around 2hrs to finish the match. But by then my mom was very angry and I was freaking .
                        <br><br>
                        So after spending 2hrs with her ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
                        <br><br>
                        Around 2pm I left her home and took a bus to my hometown and that time my mom again called me to know my location.
                        <br><br>
                        I told my mom that I am going for a movie show . One of my teammate is giving me movie treat.
                        <br><br>
                        By that time my mom was shouting on me and warned me "beta Ghar par aaoo btate h "..
                        <br><br>
                        When I finally I reached my home around 6 in the evening.I started pretending that I am too tired and not in the mood to talk and goes directly to sleep.
                        <br><br>
                        By then my mom had a fair idea where I was but not was not sure that I was out of town‚Ä¶
                        <br><br>
                        I bet you can‚Äôt fool Indian moms‚Ä¶they can easily caught you even a bit change in your behavior..!!!
                        <br><br>
                        At that time I learned ...‚Äùek jhot chupane k lia hazar jhut bolne padhte h‚Äù
                        <br><br>
                        I told my mother about that incident after my breakup ..!!!
                        <br><br>
                        I was 18 at that time and was mad in love‚Ä¶
                        <br><br>
